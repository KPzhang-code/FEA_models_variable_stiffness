# FEA_models_variable_stiffness
For the paper **Intelligent design and buckling experiment of curvilinearly stiffened thin-walled structures**, there exists here FEA model files of ABAQUS2020 for orthogonally stiffened (OS) panel and variable stiffness (VS) panel. Specifically , these contain **OS_in_design.inp**, **OS_with_imperfaction.inp**, **VS_in_design.inp_**, **VS_with_imperfaction.inp**.
